[Check out some videos!](http://snap.jglukasik.com)

I have a Raspberry Pi connected to a USB Webcam that takes a picture every
minute, and then stitches those 1440 pictures into a video at the end of the
day. It then compresses that video and posts it as a "story" on Snapchat.

It's currently under renovations, using a new Raspberry Pi camera, and having
another camera running in a different location. Also, recent Snapchat updates
have messed with things on that side of the project.

This page will be updated with the latest happenings of this project.
