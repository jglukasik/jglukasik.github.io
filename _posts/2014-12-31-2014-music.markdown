title: Some music I enjoyed in 2014
tags: blog

One day I stumbled upon my old Pandora account, and I was able to see a listing
of all the tracks I thumbed-up back in my middle school years. I loved that, and
wanted to do something similar here. This is just a dump of artists, albums, and
tracks that I listened to during the later months of 2014. It's almost entirely
for myself, to serve as a log that I can look back on in the future, but it also
can give others a little glimpse into my musical tastes.
